  <title>Network Stack as a Service</title>
  <guests>Henry Xu from City University of Hong Kong</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      <a href="https://henryhxu.github.io/">Henry Xu</a> is an assistant
      professor in the <a href="http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/">computer science
      department</a> at the <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/">City University
      of Hong Kong</a>, where he leads the <a
      href="https://netx-lab.github.io/">NetX Lab</a>.  In this episode, we
      discuss the research behind his group's recent paper <a
      href="https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N41511">Network Stack as a Service in
      the Cloud</a>, presented at <a
      href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2017/program.html">HotNets
      2017</a>.  The paper has the following abstract:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The tenant network stack is implemented inside the virtual machines in
      today's public cloud.  This legacy architecture presents a barrier to
      protocol stack innovation due to the tight coupling between the network
      stack and the guest OS.  In particular, it causes many deployment
      troubles to tenants and management and efficiency problems to the cloud
      provider.  To address these issues, we articulate a vision of providing
      the network stack as a service.  The central idea is to decouple the
      network stack from the guest OS, and offer it as an independent entity
      implemented by the cloud provider.  This re-architecting allows tenants
      to readily deploy any stack independent of its kernel, and the provider
      to offer meaningful SLAs to tenants by gaining control over the network
      stack.  We sketch an initial design called NetKernel to accomplish this
      vision.  Our preliminary testbed evaluation with a prototype shows the
      feasibility and benefits of our idea.
