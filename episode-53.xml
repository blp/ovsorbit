  <title>Ten Years of Open vSwitch Success and Failure</title>
  <description>
    <p>
      This is a talk that I gave at an internal VMware event called "Open
      Source Day" in February.  I prepared it as a kind of internal recognition
      of the ACM SOSR conference <a
      href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sosr/2018/award.html">awarding Open
      vSwitch its Software Systems Award</a>.  It goes over a history of Open
      vSwitch and the motivation behind it, factors that led to its success,
      and some of the project's failures and mixed results.

      The accompanying slides are available as <a
      href="success-and-failure.pdf">PDF</a>, although it is not necessary to
      view them to follow along.
