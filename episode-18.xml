  <title>OVN Launch</title>
  <guests>Russell Bryant from Red Hat</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      OVN is a network virtualization system that has been under development as
      part of the Open vSwitch project over about the last two years.  On this
      podcast, Ben Pfaff and Russell Bryant, two major contributors to OVN,
      describe OVN, its architecture, its features, focusing on features that
      were added in the recent release of Open vSwitch 2.6, and some future
      directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This episode is based on the material presented at the OpenStack Summit
      in the session titled ``OVN - Moving to Production.''  <a
      href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/events/15278/ovn-moving-into-production">The
      summit talk</a> was recorded and <a
      href="https://www.openstack.org/videos/video/ovn-moving-into-production-1">video</a>
      and <a
      href="http://openvswitch.org/support/slides/OVN_Barcelona.pdf">slides</a>
      are available.  This podcast follows the structure of the slides pretty
      closely, making them a useful companion document to look at while
      listening, but the episode is meant to stand alone.
