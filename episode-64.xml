  <title>Introduction to OVSDB, Part 2</title>
  <guests>Person from Organization</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      This episode, recorded in April 2018, was the third in a series of
      internal VMware tech talks about Open vSwitch.  This episode is
      particularly about OVSDB, the Open vSwitch Database, and particularly
      about OVSDB from the viewpoint of the client.  It talks about the C
      client library, including how it represents data, the usual way to work
      with it, and how it interacts with the OVSDB server.  It also covers how
      the C client library supports preparing transactions to send to the
      server.

      Part of the talk dissects and explains an OVSDB JSON-RPC transaction
      created by <code>ovs-vsctl</code>.  You can see a similar transaction by
      running <code>make sandbox</code> in an OVS tree, then <code>ovs-vsctl
      -vjsonrpc add-br br0</code> inside the sandbox.  Look for the
      <code>transact</code> operation, Or <a href="ovsdb2.txt">look at this
      example</a>, which has been put through a JSON pretty-printer for
      legibility.
    </p>

      The talk concludes with several minutes of questions.  One of the
      questions discusses the C IDL's rendering of the AutoAttach table.  You
      can find this at the top of the file <a href="ovsdb2.c.txt">here</a>.

      Part 1, in <a href="#e55">episode 55</a> covered OVSDB from the server
      and network protocol point of view.
