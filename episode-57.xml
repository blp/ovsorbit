    <p>
      Alex Ellis founded and leads the <a
      href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS project</a>, which is an open
      source implementation of a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing">serverless</a>
      framework.  This episode is an interview with Alex.  We talk about
      serverless functions and OpenFaaS, how OpenFaaS compares to other
      serverless frameworks, how networking works in OpenFaaS, open source
      communities, and other related topics.  We also take on a couple of
      questions asked by listeners on Twitter.
