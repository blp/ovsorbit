  <description>
    <p>
      Dmitry Yusupov submitted a talk to the Open vSwitch 2020 Fall Conference
      that we weren't able to fit into the schedule.  This podcast, recorded in
      December 2020, is based on the material that Dmitry presented in <a
      href="https://youtu.be/3h4i05oe5VQ">a video available on YouTube</a>.
      The <a href="episode-72-slides.pdf">slides</a> for Dmitry's talk are also
      available.

    <p>
      The abstract for this talk is:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        OVSDB (management protocol RFC 7047) is a fundamental building block of
        modern SDN architecture based on OVN/OVS. OVSDB is the key component
        that is responsible for efficient scalability of large deployments,
        such as 1000+ node Kubernetes clusters when CNI function is OVN based.
      </p>

      <p>
        OVSDB was originally designed to store configuration for Open vSwitch
        daemon, however, it was later extended to be part of OVN architecture,
        with added RAFT clustering support and improved scale-out capabilities,
        such as efficient scale-out caches.
      </p>

      <p>
        This talk brings a question of scaling up OVSDB with introduction of
        OVSDB Query Optimizer using primary and alternate key indexing.  We
        will be also looking at OVSDB with Query Optimizer as high-performance
        Key-Value API interface and compare it to ETCD.
      </p>
