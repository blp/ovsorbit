  <title>Hardware Acceleration on NICs</title>
  <guests>Andy Gospodarek from Broadcom</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      This episode features Andy Gospodarek, a Principal Engineer at Broadcom,
      where he works as a software architect on the NICs team.  This interview,
      recorded at the DPDK summit in San Jose on November 15, 2017, focuses on
      his team's work on offloading flows to Broadcom NICs, using the user's
      choice of the Linux ``TC'' flow offload API or a Broadcom-specific API.
      Toward the end, he also talks about a different kind of hardware
      acceleration using a ``Smart NIC'' with a multicore general-purpose CPU
      that can run Open vSwitch or other popular networking software.
