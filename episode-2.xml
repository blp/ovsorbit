  <description>
    <p>
      Interview with Dave Neary of Red Hat, concerning OPNFV and its
      relationship with Open vSwitch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Topics include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The difference between SFC and NFV.</li>

      <li>Importance performance constraints in NFV.</li>

      <li>Telcos and NFV, and how telcos approached OpenStack.</li>

      <li>How OPNFV bridges the telcos with OpenStack.</li>

      <li>What telcos care about, and a definition of ``carrier grade.''</li>

      <li>Why carrier-grade features matter to everyone.</li>

      <li>Downsides and tradeoffs of carrier grade, such as cost and
      complexity.</li>

      <li>Role of Open vSwitch in OPNFV, and why DPDK is important to NFV.</li>

      <li>Importance of short 64-byte packets in NFV, e.g. for RTP (Real-time
      Transport Protocol, for delivering audio and video across networks).</li>

      <li>Relationship between SIP and RTP.</li>

      <li>Status of DPDK datapath in OVS for OPNFV (still under OpenStack review
      and in early evaluation, not running in production much).</li>

      <li>Importance of <code>vhost-user</code> for NFV.</li>

      <li>Why DPDK API/ABI changes cause trouble for Open vSwitch and downstream
      users, and how symbol versioning in DPDK 2 and later helps.</li>

      <li>Problems caused by irregularly scheduled Open vSwitch 2.4 and 2.5
      releases.</li>

      <li>Intent to branch OVS 2.6 in July.</li>

      <li>SFC for OPNFV demo with Tacker.</li>

      <li>Progress toward NSH support in OVS, and why OVS support for Geneve should
      make it easier now.</li>

      <li>Geneve standardization progress.</li>

      <li>OpenFlow matching for service chains.</li>

      <li>Potential pros and cons of NSH and Geneve for service chaining.</li>

      <li>VPP and OPNFV, and guesses at pros and cons of VPP versus OVS for
      different application.</li>

      <li>Why Dave is excited about OPNFV.</li>
    </ul>
