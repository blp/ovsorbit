  <title>Incremental Processing with ovn-controller</title>
  <guests>Han Zhou from eBay</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      Han Zhou is an architect working on highly scalable and reliable SDN
      solutions for eBay's cloud infrastructure.  He is an active contributor
      in OpenStack and OVS/OVN.  Before eBay, he has been working in networking
      area for more than 10 years in Cisco and Nokia.

      In OVN, the <code>ovn-controller</code> daemon runs on each hypervisor.
      It obtains logical flows from the OVN southbound database, transforms
      them into "physical flows," and pushes the physical flows into
      <code>ovs-vswitchd</code> over an OpenFlow connection.  In the current
      implementation, whenever any of the tables in the OVN southbound database
      changed, the daemon would fully recompute all of the physical flows to be
      pushed into <code>ovs-vswitchd</code>.  With a sufficiently large setup,
      this is expensive.  This talk is about Han's patches to make computation
      in <code>ovn-controller</code> incremental, so that a small change in the
      input causes only a small amount of computation.

      Some of the talk is easier to follow if you view the slides (<a
      href="episode-59-slides.pdf">PDF</a>).

      Han was previously featured in OVS Orbit in <a href="#e36">episode
      36</a>, where he spoke about Baker, an approach used by eBay to combine
      OVN with Kubernetes.
