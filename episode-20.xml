  <title>Protocol-Independent FIB Architecture</title>

    <p>
      <a href="http://member.wide.ad.jp/~upa/">Ryo Nakamura</a> is a PhD
      student at The University of Tokyo, studying IP networking, overlay
      networking, and network operation.  This episode is a recording I made of
      his talk during <a
      href="http://www.cs.hku.hk/apsys2016/program.html">APSys 2016</a>, the
      Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems, on Aug. 5, based on <a
      href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2967372">Protocol-Independent FIB
      Architecture for Network Overlays</a>, written with co-authors Yohei Kuga
      (from Keio University), Yuji Sekiya, and Hiroshi Esaki.

      The abstract for this paper says:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      We introduce a new forwarding information base architecture into the
      stacked layering model for network overlays. In recent data center
      networks, network overlay built upon tunneling protocols becomes an
      essential technology for virtualized environments. However, the tunneling
      stacks network layers twice in the host OS, so that processing to
      transmit packets increases and throughput will degrade. First, this paper
      shows the measurement result of the degradation on a Linux kernel, in
      which throughputs in 5 tunneling protocols degrade by over 30%. Then, we
      describe the proposed architecture that enables the shortcut for the
      second protocol processing for network overlays. In the evaluation with a
      dummy interface and a modified Intel 10-Gbps NIC driver, transmitting
      throughput is improved in 5 tunneling protocols and the throughput of the
      Linux kernel is approximately doubled in particular protocols.

      Before the talk, session chair <a
      href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~fd2/">Florin Dinu</a> introduces the
      speaker.  Following the talk, the questions come from <a
      href="http://benpfaff.org">Ben Pfaff</a>, <a
      href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/">Sorav Bansal</a>, and
      Florin, respectively.  Sorav's question refers to my own talk from
      earlier the same day at the conference, which is published as <a
      href="https://ovsorbit.org/#e14">OVS Orbit Episode 14</a>.
