    <p>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/mdlayher">Matt Layher</a> and <a
      href="https://twitter.com/armandomi2001">Armando Migliaccio</a> are
      engineers focusing on networking at <a
      href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, a cloud service
      provider.  In April, <a href="https://twitter.com/Justin_D_Pettit">Justin
      Pettit</a> and I sat down with them at DigitalOcean HQ in New York City.
      This episode is our discussion, which ranges from how DO first began
      using Open vSwitch, the DO approach to network control, to scale and
      performance issues, upgrade strategy, and the Open vSwitch code that
      DigitalOcean itself is working to contribute.

      href="http://www.openvswitch.org/support/ovscon2017/">Open vSwitch 2017
      Fall Conference</a> about the use of Go with Open vSwitch at
      DigitalOcean.
