  <title>Enterprise SDN</title>
  <guests>Greg Ferro from Packet Pushers</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      <a href="http://etherealmind.com/">Greg Ferro</a> is one of the <a
      href="http://packetpushers.net/hosts/">Packet Pushers</a>, a host of much
      more popular podcasts than this one.  Greg's bio says:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Greg survived 25+ years of Enterprise IT as a network engineer, architect
      and designer. Involved with a wide range of companies in gaming, online,
      finance, carriers, energy and other, he was a team member or leader that
      designed, built and deployed quite a few medium &amp; large solutions for
      well known large companies. He was CCIE#6920 (and a bunch of others) but
      thats not relevant now.
    </blockquote>

      The conversation in this episode focuses on the relationship between
      virtual switching and enterprise networking.  According to Greg,
      microsegmentation is the key selling point for SDN in the enterprise.
      The idea of pulling a whole physical network into a virtual environment,
      which was one of Nicira's use cases, is starting to acquire some currency
      in enterprises, although there's a great deal of stickiness from sales of
      physical hardware firewalls and other appliances:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "...so the customer says, 'I really like that poop sandwich, can I have
      another one?' and they don't realize that right next to it is a chicken
      sandwich if only they knew to ask for a chicken sandwich, so they get the
      poop sandwich and they go, 'Mmm, tastes just like the last one!  Exactly
      what I wanted!'"
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      One important aspect of the Nicira vision was agility, the ability to add
      or change networks quickly without involving the networking team.
      According to Greg, this is not yet important to enterprises because they
      lack the belief that it really works:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "They're too used to being lied to...  When you come to them and say,
      'We've got all this agility and speed!' they just at you going, 'Why
      would I need that?'  ...  They don't trust what they're being told
      because they have a history of getting un-trustable advice."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Ben and Greg also briefly discuss SD-WAN and NFV.  Greg expresses a
      theory that the end of net neutrality will terminate telco interest in
      ONAP and CORD.  Greg expresses positivity about hardware with flow-based
      control APIs such as OpenFlow and P4.
    </p>

    <p>
      Greg offers an opinion about public cloud in enterprises:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "I think we're going to see most people go into the public cloud,
      re-engineer, learn cloud principles, and then start to deploy it back.
      When will that happen?  When we start to see the legacy IT vendors build
      hyperconverged platforms running things like OpenShift, and you won't
      even know it's OpenShift, it'll just be a private cloud, and
      clicky-clicky, here's an IaaS, here's a VM, here's a storage, here's a
      connection to the Internet, there's my public IP, boom!"
    </blockquote>
