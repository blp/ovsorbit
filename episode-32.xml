      Alessandro is CTO of Cloudbase Solutions, a company focused on cloud
      computing interoperability and the main contributor of all the OpenStack
      Windows and Hyper-V components in Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Ceilometer and
      Heat since the Folsom release.  Alin is a developer at Cloudbase who

      This episode is a talk that Alessandro and Alin gave at OpenStack Boston
      during the Open vSwitch Open Source Day on May 10, with the following
      abstract:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Current Windows datapath development aids users and simplifies
        networking deployments. One of the improvements brings Linux Bridges
        (OVS bridges) mentality under Windows. Recent development also allows
        for OVN to work together with the Windows datapath. This session will
        cover how it can be achieved on Windows under Hyper-V as well. Among
        other topics, we will cover how to set up OVN using DevStack and add a
        Windows node and how to debug Windows-specific problems, with a demo.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, one of the recent and interesting integration of OVN is
        Kubernetes. This helps users to deploy containers over both public and
        private clouds. Cloudbase Solutions recently added a PoC (proof of
        concept) integration for Windows. This allows Windows workloads to be
        deployed under the same cluster. We will emphasize on the advantages
        that can be achieved using this type of approach. We will explain how
        to set up an environment including a Windows node and play a
        prerecorded demo.
      </p>

      The demos may be of less interest than the rest of the talk because no
      video is available.  If you want to skip over them, they run from 8:27 to
      13:06 and from 20:56 to 28:03.
