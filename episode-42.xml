      Nicholas Gray is a PhD student at the University of Würzburg, Germany,
      where he also completed his Master's thesis in 2015.  His research
      interests include SDN/NFV architectures and their impact on network
      security.  Thomas Zinner received his Diploma and Ph.D degrees in
      computer science from the University of Wurzburg, Germany, in 2007 and
      2012, respectively.  Nicholas is a member of the research group headed by
      Thomas on ``Next Generation Networks'' at the Chair of Communication
      Networks, University of Würzburg.

      This episode is about FlowFuzz, a framework for fuzzing OpenFlow-enabled
      software and hardware switches.  It covers the <a

      presented</a> by Nicholas at Black Hat Briefings on July 26, in a session
      with the following abstract:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm which
        aims for increasing the flexibility of current network deployments by
        separating the data from the control plane and by providing
        programmable interfaces to configure the network.  Resulting in a more
        agile and eased network management and therefore in cost savings, SDN
        is already deployed in live networks i.e. Google's B4 backbone and
        NOKIA's cloud infrastructure.  Despite these benefits, SDN broadens the
        attack surface as additional networking devices and protocols are
        deployed.  Due their critical role within the softwarized management of
        the network, these devices and protocols are high ranked targets for
        potential attackers and thus require extensive testing and hardening.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this work, we present FlowFuzz a fuzzing framework for SDN-enabled
        software and hardware switches.  In particular we focus on the OpenFlow
        protocol which is currently the de facto standard communication
        protocol between SDN-enabled switches and the central controlling
        instance.  Whereas the framework utilizes the output of conventional
        tools such as AddressSanitizer for investigating software switches, it
        also evaluates data obtained from side channels, i.e., processing times
        and power consumption to identify unique code execution paths within
        hardware switches to optimize the fuzzing process.  Furthermore, we use
        our framework implementation to perform a first evaluation of the Open
        vSwitch and a total of four SDN-enabled hardware switches.  We conclude
        by presenting our findings and outline future extensions of the fuzzing
        framework.
