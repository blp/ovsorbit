    <p>
      This episode is a series of 3 lightning talks given at OpenStack Boston
      during the Open vSwitch Open Source Day on May 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first speaker is Joe Stringer, a developer at VMware who works on
      Open vSwitch.  The title of his talk, which starts at 1:03, is
      ``Deploying an OVS-based feature switch in 5 minutes or less.''  It
      consists of a demo showing how to quickly deploy the Faucet open source
      OpenFlow controller as a drop-in replacement for a network switch.  This
      talk did not include slides, but you can watch a video recording of a
      similar demo on <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuqzzjmcwlI">youtube</a>.  For more
      coverage of Faucet, see <a href="#e19">episode 19</a> or Shivaram
      Mysore's talk at the <a
      href="http://openvswitch.org/support/ovscon2016/">Open vSwitch 2016 Fall
      Conference</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second speaker is Yusuke Tatsumi, a network infrastructure engineer
      at Yahoo! JAPAN, with ``Continuous Integration for IaaS,'' about a
      continuous integration tool chain for Open vSwitch with DPDK.  This talk
      begins at 4:54.  <a

      are available.

    <p>
      The third speaker is also Joe Stringer, presenting ``Cyber RFP!'' about
      the strategy that the Faucet open source OpenFlow controller uses to
      validate a switch's OpenFlow support using a comprehensive, easy-to-use
      testsuite.  This talk begins at 10:53.  <a
