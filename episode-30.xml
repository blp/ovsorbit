      Bingzhe Liu is a first-year PhD student at University of Illinois at
      Urbana-Champaign.  In this episode, we discuss the paper ``<a
      href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sosr/2017/papers/sosr17-neat.pdf">NEAt:
      Network Error Auto-Correct</a>,'' by Wenxuan Zhou, Jason Croft, Bingzhe
      Liu, and Matthew Caesar, which Bingzhe presented on April 4 at <a
      href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sosr/2017/program.html">SOSR</a>,
      the Symposium on SDN Research.  The abstract for this paper is:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Configuring and maintaining an enterprise network is a challenging and
        error-prone process.  Administrators must often consider security
        policies from a variety of sources simultaneously, including regulatory
        requirements, industry standards, and to mitigate attack vectors.
        Erroneous implementation of a policy, however, can result in costly
        data breaches and intrusions.  Relying on humans to discover and
        troubleshoot violations is slow and prone to error, considering the
        speed at which new attack vectors propagate and the increasing network
        dynamics, partly an effect of SDN. To ensure the network is always in a
        state consistent with the desired policies, administrators need
        frameworks to automatically diagnose and repair violations in
        real-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        To address this problem, we present NEAt, a system analogous to a
        smartphoneâ€™s autocorrect feature that enables on-the-fly repair to
        policy-violating updates.  NEAt modifies the forwarding behavior of
        updates to automatically repair violations of properties such as
        reachability, service chaining, and segmentation.  NEAt sits between an
        SDN controller and the forwarding devices, and intercepts updates
        proposed by SDN applications.  If an update violates the policy defined
        by an administrator, such as reachability or segmentation, NEAt
        transforms the update into one that complies with the policy. Unlike
        domain-specific languages or synthesis platforms, NEAt allows
        enterprise networks to leverage the advanced functionality of SDN
        applications while simultaneously achieving strong, automated
        enforcement of general policies.
