  <title>The Faucet SDN Controller</title>
  <guests>Josh Bailey from Google and Shivaram Mysore from ONF</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      Faucet is an open source SDN controller developed by a community that
      includes engineers at Google's New Zealand office, the Open Networking
      Foundation (ONF), and others.  This episode is an interview with <a
      href="http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/Users/Josh/WebHome">Josh Bailey</a>
      from Google and Shivaram Mysore from the ONF.  It was recorded on Nov. 7,
      at <a href="http://openvswitch.org/support/ovscon2016/">Open vSwitch 2016
      Fall Conference</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The episode begins with a description of Faucet's goals.  Unlike the
      higher profile <a href="https://www.opendaylight.org/">Open Daylight</a>
      and <a href="http://onosproject.org/">ONOS controllers</a>, which focus
      on performance at high scale, Faucet places simplicity, ease of
      development, and small code size as higher purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also in contrast to most controllers, Faucet does not contain code
      specific to individual vendors or models of OpenFlow switch.  Rather, it
      targets any OpenFlow 1.3 switches that fulfill its minimum multi-table
      and other requirements, using a pipeline of tables designed to be
      suitable for many purposes.  In Josh's words, ``The most important one
      was tables.  Once you have tables, you can say `if-then'.  If you don't
      have tables, you can only go `if-and-and-and-and'.''
    </p>

    <p>
      Faucet development has focused on deployments.  Several Faucet users have
      come forward to publicly talk about their use, with the highest profile
      of those being the <a
      href="https://faucet-sdn.blogspot.com/2016/06/faucet-at-open-network-foundation.html">Open
      Networking Foundation deployment</a> at their own offices.  See also a <a

      of public deployments</a>.  Shiva describes a temporary deployment at the
      ONF Member Workdays for conference wi-fi use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Performance is not a focus for Faucet.  Instead, developers encourage
      users to experiment with deployments and find out whether there is an
      actual performance in practice.  Shivaram reports that this has worked
      out well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Faucet can control even very low-end switches, such as the <a
      href="https://northboundnetworks.com/products/zodiac-fx">Zodiac</a>, a
      4-port switch from Northbound Networks that costs AUD $99 (about USD
      $75).  Faucet itself has low memory and CPU requirements, which mean that
      it can run on low-end hardware such as Raspberry Pi (about $30), which
      has actually been deployed as a production controller for enterprise use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Last summer, the ONF hosted a <a
      href="http://octest.in/sdnhackfest/index.html">Faucet hackfest</a> in
      Bangalore, where each team was supplied its own ``Pizod,'' a combination
      of a Zodiac and Raspberry Pi, for development.  Hackers at the hackfest
      were required to have Python experience, but not networking or OpenFlow
      experience.  Each team of 4, which included a documentation and a UX
      person, chose a project from an assigned list of possibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Faucet records the state of the system, over time, to an InfluxDB
      database and exposes that for inspection through a Grafana dashboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Faucet code is small, about 2,500 lines of code.  About this size,
      Josh says, ``I'd be surprised if it gets about four times the size,
      because we've got quite a clear idea of its scope...  Think of Faucet as
      your autonomic nervous system, a small important part of your brain but
      it keeps you breathing and it reacts to high-priority threats before your
      conscious mind sets in.  You keep that code small and you test the heck
      out of it.''
    </p>

    <p>
      Josh is working on extending support for distributed switching within
      Faucet.  Troubleshooting large L2 fabrics is especially frustrating, and
      Josh aims to make it easier.  Shiva is encouraging deployments,
      especially feedback from deployments, and control over wi-fi.  Other
      priorities are better dashboards and better IPv6 support.
