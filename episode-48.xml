  <description>
    <p>
      This is a recording of a talk given by Ben Pfaff at the OpenStack Summit
      in Sydney on Monday, Nov. 6, with the follow abstract:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The Open vSwitch (OVS) community recently released version 2.8.  The
      release includes updates to both OVS and OVN (Open Virtual Network),
      which provides virtual networking for OVS.  This presentation will
      primarily focus on updates to OVN and how OpenStack can use it as a
      backend for OpenStack Neutron. OVN has continued to grow and mature as an
      OpenStack networking solution. Recent additions include HA for L3
      gateways, native DNS support, ACL (security group) logging, and support
      for the OpenStack metadata API.  We will also discuss current and future
      developments for OVS and OVN.
