  <title>OpenStack Performance with OVS-DPDK for NFV and Connection Tracking</title>
  <guests>Sugesh Chandran and Bhanuprakash Bodireddy from Intel</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      Sugesh Chandran is a network software engineer with Intel.  His work is
      primarily focused on accelerated software switching solutions in user
      space running on Intel architecture.  His contributions to Open vSwitch
      with DPDK include tunneling acceleration and enabling hardware
      acceleration.  Before joining Intel, he has been involved in developing
      features for Cisco and Procurve switching products.

      Bhanuprakash is a software engineer at Intel Corporation focusing on
      virtual switching solutions.  Before joining Intel, he has been involved
      in building telecom solutions for Asian mobile operators and had
      significant contributions towards fast-path optimization in vEPC.  He
      also worked on building reliable fronthaul solution at a startup that
      built vRAN using Ethernet fronthaul.  He is also passionate about FOSS
      and has actively contributed to FreeBSD MIPS and OVS.

      This episode is a talk that Sugesh and Bhanuprakash gave at OpenStack
      Boston during the Open vSwitch Open Source Day on May 10, with the
      following abstract:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This talk analyzes the performance of OVS-DPDK in two situations
        relevant to OpenStack.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, the speakers will analyze the performance of the OVS-DPDK
        connection tracker, which plays a critical role in protecting tenants
        and application workloads from network-based attacks.  They will demo
        and wal kthrough their findings with different test topologies that
        includes multiple VMs, bridges with thousands of connections.  They
        will showcase Vtune results for specific bottlenecks and discuss
        mitigation strategies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, the speakers will analyze the performance of OVS-DPDK for
        Network Function Virtualization (NFV).  This part of the talk will
        describe a few real world deployment with OVS-DPDK and walk through
        various scenarios.  This includes latency details, scalability, NUMA
        node aware allocation, classifier bottleneck, noisy neighbor and
        hardware acceleration features.
      </p>
