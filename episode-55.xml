  <title>Introduction to OVSDB</title>
  <description>
    <p>
      This is the second in a series of Open vSwitch tech talks that we are
      starting to run internally at VMware every week or two.  This episode is
      particularly about OVSDB, the Open vSwitch Database.  It starts out with
      material explaining why OVSDB exists at all, given that there is so much
      other work in databases and in network configuration.  Then it moves on
      to what OVSDB is and its basic features, including the features that its
      schemas support.  It also discusses the basics of the OVSDB network
      protocol.  It concludes with several minutes of questions.
