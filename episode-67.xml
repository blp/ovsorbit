      Levente Csikor and Gabor Retvari from the Budapest University of
      Technology and Economics present their talk “The Discrepancy of the
      Megaflow Cache in OVS” at the Open vSwitch Fall Conference in San Jose
      in December 2018.  A few days later, they visited me to have this
      discussion for the podcast about their work.  This episode is a discussion of their work and their results.
