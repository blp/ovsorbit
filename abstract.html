      <p>
	OVS Orbit is always seeking new content.  To propose an
	episode, please email <a href="mailto:blp@ovn.org">Ben
	Pfaff</a> with a little bit about yourself and the proposed
	topic and perhaps a few aspects of it that are worth
	exploring.
      </p>

      <p>
	OVS Orbit interviews aim to be between 30 and 45 minutes long,
	but some end up being shorter or longer.
      </p>

      <p>
	Recording episodes in person maximizes audio quality, but it
	is also possible to record phone calls, etc.
      </p>

      <h1>Episode Outline</h1>

      <p>
	There are many possible interview formats, but in practice
	most OVS Orbit episodes follow the general outline below.

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <p>Host introduction: Host announces the program and names and
	  briefly introduces the guests.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Guest introduction: Guests add some details about themselves.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Topic introduction: Guest or host introduces the high-level
	  topic and adds enough background that people can follow if
	  they don't already know anything about the topic, but do
	  have a basic background in networking in SDN.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Topic followup: What are the use cases for the topic, where
	  did it come from, how did you get involved with it, what's
	  the motivation for it, what keeps you interested in this
	  area, how does the business model work?</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    Zeroing in on a subtopic: Host and guests discuss some
	    aspect of the overall topic that they (ideally) identified
	    in advance, and go into depth about it.  It's nice to
	    identify multiple potential topics just in case the
	    discussion on one turns out to be short.  If the subtopic
	    isn't directly related to Open vSwitch or software
	    switching, this segment tries to draw out some
	    relationship.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    This is usually the longest part of the podcast.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Future: What's happening next, in the subtopic or larger
	  topic?  What are issues for concern?  What questions need to
	  be answered?</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Other: Is there anything else the interviewee wants to talk
	  about that we missed?</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>Finding out more: Where should listeners go to find out
	  more, such as a project website.  Sometimes, contact
	  information for the speakers, such as a personal website or
	  Twitter or other social media handle.</p>
	</li>
      </ol>
