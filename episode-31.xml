  <title>NetBricks: Taking the V out of NFV</title>
  <guests>A. Panda from Berkeley</guests>
  <description>

    <p>
      Panda is a PhD candidate in the computer science department at the
      University of California, Berkeley.  In this episode, we discuss the
      paper ``<a
      href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~apanda/assets/papers/osdi16.pdf">NetBricks:
      Taking the V out of NFV</a>,'' by Panda, Sangjin Han, Keon Jang, Melvin
      Walls, Sylvia Ratnasamy, and Scott Shenker, which was published in <a
      href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi16">OSDI 2016</a>.  The
      abstract for the paper is:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The move from hardware middleboxes to software network functions, as
      advocated by NFV, has proven more challenging than expected. Developing
      new NFs remains a tedious process, requiring that developers repeatedly
      rediscover and reapply the same set of optimizations, while current
      techniques for providing isolation between NFs (using VMs or containers)
      incur high performance overheads. In this paper we describe NetBricks, a
      new NFV framework that tackles both these problems. For building NFs we
      take inspiration from modern data analytics frameworks (e.g., Spark and
      Dryad) and build a small set of customizable network processing
      elements. We also embrace type checking and safe runtimes to provide
      isolation in software, rather than rely on hardware isolation. NetBricks
      provides the same memory isolation as containers and VMs, without
      incurring the same performance penalties. To improve I/O efficiency, we
      introduce a novel technique called zero-copy software isolation.

      One of my favorite quotes from the discussion is the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The fewer lines of code you have to reason about, the easier it is.
      That's the lesson that, I would guess, if you're a developer, to take
      away.  Don't think of isolation as this thing you do for security.
      That's one use case, it's not even a very good use case because everyone
      seems to violate isolation all the time: there's ten bugs on any given
      day for hypervisors breaking out of their isolation boundary.
    </blockquote>
