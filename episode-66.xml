  <title>OVS Hardware Offload</title>
  <guests>Simon Horman from Netronome</guests>
  <description>
    <p>
      Simon Horman has been an Open vSwitch contributor and committer since
      2010.  He currently works for Netronome, where his Open vSwitch work
      centers around hardware offload using the &quot;<code>tc</code>&quot; API
      integrated into the Linux kernel.  This API allows users of Open vSwitch
      to transparently obtain better performance: when offload is enabled with
      a compatible network card, Open vSwitch works the same way, but faster.

      <li>The architecture of Netronome NICs</li>

      <li>How the offload API works</li>

      <li>Handling state (such as connection tracking state) in hardware
      offload</li>

      <li>Limitations of hardware offload, such as memory and other resource
      limits</li>

      <li>Extending hardware offload to DPDK</li>

      <li>The possibility of classification-only offload</li>

      <li>Offload interaction with the OVS caching hierarchy</li>

      <li>The cost of offload</li>

      <li>Kernel politics of the offload API</li>

      <li>Applications for offload</li>
