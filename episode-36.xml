      This episode is a talk that Han gave at OpenStack Boston during the Open
      vSwitch Open Source Day on May 10, with the following abstract:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Han presents ``Baker,'' a new approach used by eBay to combine OVN with
      Kubernetes API server to meet the scalability and availability goal in a
      large scale production environment, and how it is integrated with Neutron
      Security Group to achieve micro-segmentation.  This allows OVN to scale
      beyond the limits of OVSDB as the centralized data store.
    </blockquote>
