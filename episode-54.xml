  <title>RCU in Open vSwitch Userspace</title>
  <description>
    <p>
      This is the first in a series of Open vSwitch tech talks that we are
      starting to run internally at VMware every week or two.  This episode is
      particularly about <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update">read-copy-update</a>,
      or RCU for short, which is a synchronization technique that allows reads
      to be very cheap (almost free), with some memory cost.  This talk covers
      reasons why RCU can be preferred over other techniques, such as <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writer_lock">readers-writer
      locks</a>, and its relationship with lockless synchronization and
      reference counts.  It also covers some of the RCU API within OVS (and why
      OVS has its own API instead of using <a
      href="http://liburcu.org/">liburcu</a>).

      The <a

      header from the OVS source repository is useful reading along with this
      episode.
